Changes for Version 2.1
=======================

* Added a parsed() method to ComplexResult, that holds that part of the
  complex strings parsed data.

* Moved the RollResult and ComplexResult structures into their own classes.
  This allows for more methods to be added to them dynamically, in an 
  easier way.

* The Dice::Roll class now remembers the last roll, which can be obtained
  via the result() method. If the instance has yet to to do a roll, then
  roll() is called first.

* Cleaned up code in the RollPart#parse() method, removing some legacy
  variables that no longer apply to the 2.* version of the library.

* Added this ChangeLog! :D
